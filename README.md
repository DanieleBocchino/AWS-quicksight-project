## Introduction
This mini project created using AWS Services - Amazon S3 and Amazon Quicksight. This project aims to provide instructions on how to use AWS services to create visualizations from large datasets.

## Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

- Download a dataset of 50,000 best-selling Amazon products from GitHub.
- Store the dataset into an Amazon S3 bucket.
- Connect the S3 bucket with Amazon Quicksight to create a few interesting visualizations.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is a subset of data from a huge dataset that was provided by Bright Data. Bright Data is a leading data collection company that collects public web data at scale. They provide web scripting tools in their IDE as well as ready-to-use datasets. In this project, the dataset provided by Bright Data includes a list of the Amazon bestseller products.
